Dhyan Chand (29 August 1905 â€“ 3 December 1979) was an Indian field hockey player widely regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport.[4] He was known for his extraordinary goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey. His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964.

Known as The Wizard[5][6] or The Magician[7][8] of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played internationally from 1926 to 1949; he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his autobiography, Goal.[9] The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour of Padma Bhushan in 1956.[10] His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year.
